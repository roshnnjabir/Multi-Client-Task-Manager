# TaskMate

**TaskMate** is a small full-stack application built with **Django REST Framework (DRF)** and **React**.  
It includes basic **task management**, **chat**, and **user management** features with **role-based access control** (Admin and User).

This was my **first full-stack application** using:

- **Django REST Framework** for building APIs
- **React + Redux** for the frontend
- **Django Channels** to implement real-time chat functionality

It helped me learn a lot about backend API development, state management, and real-time communication.

## Tech Stack

- **Authentication**: Token-based authentication  
- **User Roles**: Role-based access control (Admin and User)
