# TaskMate

**TaskMate** is a small full-stack application built with **Django REST Framework (DRF)** and **React**.  
It includes basic **task management**, **chat**, and **user management** functionality.  

This is the first application where I implemented **chat functionality** and used **Redux** for state management.
